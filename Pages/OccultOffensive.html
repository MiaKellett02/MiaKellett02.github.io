                        <p>
                            In August 2022, our team of 6 participated in the Brackeys game jam with the theme "You're not alone.".
                            We developed a cooperative tower defense game in unity, with one player managing towers using the mouse, 
                            while the other controlled a 2D character with a gamepad to combat enemies. 
                            This fit the theme by promoting cooperation between the players.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We originally designed the game for web browsers, but during testing, we encountered issues with gamepad functionality 
                            in the web-GL build. As a result, we decided to keep the web-GL version available for casual tower defense enthusiasts 
                            while also offering a desktop build for players interested in the cooperative mode.

                            My contributions to Occult Offensive included:
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            - Enemies: Pathfinding, health and attacks.
                            <br>
                            - Enemy Wave Managment: including what types of enemies to spawn and what the spawn rate was.
                            <br>
                            - Audio Management: using triggers to play game music when entering the level and using C# game events to trigger sound effects.
                            <br>
                            - Player Towers: aiming, tower attacks and integration with tower shop that another team member made.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In addition to these systems I also was heavily involved in the initial design of the game as well as helping
                            other team members in debugging and getting other gameplay systems ready for the game jam deadline.
