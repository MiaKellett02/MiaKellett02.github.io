                    <p>
                        This Unreal Mechanics Sandbox started off as a university assignment For which we were required to demonstrate understanding 
                        of the Unreal Engine and C++ by implementing a minimum of 5 distinct mechanics.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Each mechanic had to be implemented in C++.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Each mechanic had to be showcased in an individual, separate level.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The project had to include a "hub" level in which any "player could use totransport themselves to each of the test levels 
                            (as shown in the screenshot below.)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        When creating each mechanic, and level to display them in, I went through a number of steps.
                        First I decided what mechanic I should create. Secondly, I broke down what systems were needed for that mechanics.
                        Thirdly, I checked if there was any other sub-mechanic or another mechanic that could use this system to demonstrate what it can do.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For example, in the screenshot above, you can see the Puzzle Mechanics level I made for the project. 
                        In this level, the first thing I made was a simple pushable box that you could push into a ditch to then be able to cross the ditch.
                        But then I realised I could also use a smaller version of the box as a key for a door so I then create a button mechanic that was pressed
                        when a box was pushed into it and the adjacent door would then open.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There is also a teleported included inside of each level so that when the player wants to return to the hub level, they can.
                        On some levels this is included past an obstacle, such as in the puzzle mechanics level. 
                        In other levels the hub teleported is freely accessible from the start.
