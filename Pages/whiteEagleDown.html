                        White Eagle Down is a project created for the Global Game Jam 2022.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We had 48 hours to create a game for this competition to then submit to be played by other participants.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The goal of the game is to explore the plane environment to find items that allow you to complete objectives.
                        The final objective being to "crash the plane".

                    <p>
                        When exploring the level, the player can encounter these glowing brown boxes.
                        These represent cargo boxes that the player can interact with to obtain items to be used throughout the game.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The glow effect was created using unity's Shadergraph package.
                        Shadergraph is a visual scripting system for shaders and I used it to apply a glowing version of the fresnel effect
                        to any object this material/shader is applied to.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This glowing effect grabs the attention of the user as it singles out the objects in the scene they can interact with from ones that cannot be interact with.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The same fresenel effect shader is also used for the objective's in the game. This time with a red tint instead of a blue one.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Like the blue-tinted boxes, the player can interact with these. However, instead of being granted an 
                        item the objective manager checks if the player has the correct item to proceed with the objective (e.g. a key).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If the player has the correct item they are given a notification that they've managed to complete the objective successfully.
                        However if not, they are given a notification telling them what item they need to retrieve to be able to proceed further.
