                    <p>
                        This project was for a module called experimental games in which we were placed into teams and 
                        tasked with developing a unique game prototype that followed any of the following categories.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Creating unexpected play experiences or promoting unique feelings within players through gameplay mechanics.</li>
                        <li>Generative games, where the gameplay or world changes based on the choices the player makes.</li>
                        <li>Emergent gameplay, where the game systems interact to provide surprising interactions..</li>
                        <li>Innovative user interfaces.</li>
                        <li>Novel multiplayer interactions.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        We were able to use any game engine we wished to create the experience as long as the type of gameplay followed any of the above categories. 
                        Our team decided to a develop a game using the leap motion controller

                        During the first week of the module we were placed into the teams and I was made team leader for the group named "Team 15".
                        We were then tasked with creating a proposal for a game that we would present to the rest of the class and module tutors.
                        As the team lead, I made contact with each member of the team and organised a meeting to discuss options for what we wished to do for the project.
                        To ensure minimal conflict I got the team to discuss potential ideas and then I put each of them to a vote and whichever one we created our proposal for.

                        The result is Handball using the leap motion as a controller.
                        A penalty shootout game where you flick the ball into the goal to see how many times you can score against the goalkeeper.

                        As well as my responsibilities as team leader I was also responsible for programming the following systems:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Audio Management.</li>
                        <li>Football physics within unity using rigidbodies.</li>
                        <li>Flicking gesture recognition using the leap motion controller.</li>
                    </ul>
