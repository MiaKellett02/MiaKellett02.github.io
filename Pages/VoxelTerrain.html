                        <p>
                            This project was made for a module in which we were tasked with creating some form of procedural tool within the
                            Unity Game Engine. We were required to make a video tutorial covering a topic of our choice within some form of procedural Generation
                            (that was approved by the teachers).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Since this assignment was so vague it left alot of room to experiment with different procedural generation techniques before I finally
                            landed on the marching cubes algorithm. A technique to generate voxel terrain.

                            When deciding what I wanted to do for this assignment I knew I wanted to do some form of terrain generation, however I didn't
                            want to do the simple adjusting a plain by a heightmap that so many terrains do. This led me into researching how voxel terrain generation
                            (like Minecraft or games like Space Engineers).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The best technique I found for this was the marching cubes algorithm. I won't get into the technical detail here (as I explain how
                            it works in detail in the linked video), however I will say it was designed to convert medical scanning data into a 3D model that
                            could then be visualised by a computer.

                        <p>
                            Using all of these systems I designed a tool that allowed any developer or designer to
                            add a script that would generate a fully 3-Dimensional terrain with chunks and multi-threading
                            to speed up the generation of the terrain.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            To make it as designer friendly as possible I added the following features using unity custom editor scripts:
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            1. Noise settings that affect the shape of the terrain.
                            <br>
                            2. Chunk settings that can effect how fast it generates.
                            <br>
                            3. Level of detail settings that affect how detailed the mesh will be.
                            <br>
                            4. Buttons to start generation of the level and destroy the level.
