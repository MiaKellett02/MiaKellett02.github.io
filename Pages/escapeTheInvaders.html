                        Escape the invaders is a game where you play as a medieval knight that has to escape a attacking army and reach the castle in time.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Starting off asa game jam project, where my team was taking part in a competition to create a game to the "leave somethign behind" theme in a week, we wanted to keep the concept simple but fun.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Which is why we decided on making our game have 3 core features central to the gameplay.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The game has a character that can be upgraded to have more health or stamina.</li>
                        <li>There are arrows that fire at the player that will hurt the player.</li>
                        <li>The player has stamina that they can use to dodge the arrows but when it runs out they move slower.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        These 3 features ensure the player has options for how they want to play. 
                        Do they want to play as a fast nimble knight? 
                        Or do they want to play as a tank that will take every hit?
                    </p>

                    <!--Put some more technical detail in this article (copy and past this article if more technical detail needs to be explained).-->

                        To keep the gameplay simple for the player, it was decided that as they are ingame they gain the coins they use to upgrade passively.
                        This means that the further the player gets along in the level, they gain more coins they can then spend on upgrades.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If the player decided to upgrade their health with their coins, they will be able to take more hits from arrows before dying.
                        Alternatively, if the player decided to upgrade their stamina instead, they will be able to dodge arrows easier as they will be
                        able to move nimbly for longer.
                    </p>

                    <!--Put some more technical detail in this article (copy and past this article if more technical detail needs to be explained).-->
                    <p>
                        Having made it so that the player gains coins passively, this means that whether they are new to the game or have played it alot,
                        they can feel like they are progressing and having fun.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The more they fail, the more they can upgrade their character which will give them an even higher chance of winning next time
                         and give them a sense of acomplishment when they do finally reach the end of the level.
                    </p>
