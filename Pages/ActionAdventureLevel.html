                        <p>
                            This was for an assignment in a module called Level Design in which I was paired up with another student to create a cohesive 2 level
                            experience for an action-adventure game. We were required to research, design and breakdown a concept for our levels and document it
                            in a wiki for the module tutors.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            After we had finished the initial design phase, using node-diagrams, moodboards and a top-down map, the development of the levels started.
                            Using Unreal Engine 4 we developed our concepts into a fully-fledged level that we then playtested. Using feedback from playtesting
                            we then improved the levels based upon that feedback before the final submission.

                        <p>
                            For my team's game we decided to make our levels with the theme that you were a pilot that crashlanded in a remote region of Vietnam
                            with the ultimate goal of reaching a large radio tower to call in support to evacuate yourself, with secondary goals of disrupting
                            enemy plans.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I was responsible for the first level in the project and decided I would treat it like it was a tutorial level at the start of the
                            theoretical game we were making these levels for. Because of this I focussed on ensuring the combat and movement mechancis package
                            we were given as part of this module (Advanced Locomotion Sytem) were taught to the player in a "do not tell" way. To do this,
                            I only told the player the very basic controls for a mechanic and then presented them with a situation in which they could use it.

                        <!--Put some more technical detail in this article (copy and past this article if more technical detail needs to be explained).-->
                        <p>
                            The pattern of teaching the player a mechanic and then presenting them with a situation in which to use it continued throughout the
                            level, culminating in the final room in which the player was presented with a number of enemies that they could use the stealth
                            and combat mechanics to fight. Or the player could just sneak and push boxes to create a path to escape the cavern they had found
                            themselves in.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Once the player exited this large cavern, they would find themselves in a tunnel that would load them into the second level.

                            Which leads onto the second level which my team-partner, Edward Thompson, created. This level expanded upon the first level
                            by giving the player more challenge with many more opponents and a less spread out than in the first level. In addition
                            this level expands upon the narrative of the game more by showing a straight-forward military based with the main-objective
                            (the radio tower) visible throughout the whole level.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Although I did not work on the layout or design of this level, I worked with my partner to ensure there was a consistent theme
                            and narrative throughout the first and second level. In addition as the second level had more objectives for the player to
                            complete, I created an objectives manager using Unreal Engine Blueprints that my partner could use to decide what objectives
                            the player should complete and within which order they should be completed in. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In addition, I also made the functionality for the mines that were used within the minefield in the second level.
